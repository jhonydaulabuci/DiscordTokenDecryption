# DiscordTokenDecryption
This is an exe that has been reversed engineered; it is written in .NET and STILL contains malware.
The malware is in the resources, it gets downloaded and gets executed, goodluck.
Use ILSpy or DnSpy to see the code.
However feel free to make software that uses this code to decrypt the new RickRoll discord token encryption, just give me credits.
